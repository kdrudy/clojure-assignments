# Clojure Basics

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

## Description

Try to get as far as you can with [ClojureScript koans](http://clojurescriptkoans.com/), a browser-based challenge similar to the [Java koans](https://gist.github.com/oakes/5ca72ed74dfad3a61e7e) project we worked with in the past. Consider reading through [Do Things: A Clojure Crash Course](http://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/) to review Clojure fundamentals.

## Requirements

* Get as far as you can in ClojureScript koans.
* Optional: Make an account on [4clojure](https://www.4clojure.com/problems) and try those problems as well.
