## A New Perspective

The programming world is full of a stunning variety of languages. If you drew out a graph containing each language and what influenced it, you'd have something similar to a family tree. It's tremendously valuable to try learning a variety of them to open your mind about different ways to solve the same problem.

There are two primary ways we categorize programming languages: **syntax** (how it looks) and **paradigm** (how it works). The syntax is about the visual character of the language, while the paradigm is about the way that language accomplishes its tasks.

### Syntax

The most popular syntax today is derived from **C**. Generally, languages with C-like syntax define variables with an `=` sign, call functions by writing their name followed by parenthesis, and write code blocks using curly braces.

Clojure, on the other hand, uses a syntax derived from **Lisp**. Lisp is the second oldest programming language (after Fortran), and its defining feature is that the syntax is completely regular; everything is written the same way.

Let's look at a side-by-side comparison:

| **C syntax**                         | **Lisp syntax**                     |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `int score = 1;`                     | `(def score 1)`                     |
| `sayHello("Alice");`                 | `(say-hello "Alice")`               |
| `if (isDone) { sayHello("Alice"); }` | `(if is-done? (say-hello "Alice"))` |

In Clojure, everything is defined by placing values between parenthesis, and making the first item the name of the action. It doesn't matter if that action is defining a variable, calling a function, or starting an `if` statement; they are all written the same way.

### Paradigm

The most popular paradigm is object-oriented programming, which binds variables and functions together into a discrete units called objects. They typically use those functions (which they call methods) to modify those variables.

Clojure uses a different paradigm called functional programming, in which all functions are "standalone". Moreover, it shuns direct modification of variables, preferring instead to have functions return a new copy at the end.

### From Java to Clojure

Making the leap from Java to Clojure is a big one because both the syntax and the paradigm is different. Java is a *C-like*, *object-oriented* language. Clojure is a *Lisp-like*, *functional* language. This is not an easy change to make, but in doing so, you can learn a whole new way of programming and learn to be curious, rather than fearful, when approaching unfamiliar subjects.
