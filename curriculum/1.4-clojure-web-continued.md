## tic-tac-toe-clojure

We'll begin with a small exercise. Let's write a function that takes a two-dimensional vector representing a tic-tac-toe board, and returns whether either side has won. In Nightcode, create a console project called `tic-tac-toe-clojure`. In core.clj, start by defining the board:

```clojure
(ns tic-tac-toe-clojure.core
  (:gen-class))

(def board [[:x :e :o]
            [:x :e :e]
            [:x :e :o]])

(defn -main []
  (println "Hello, World!"))
```

The `:e` spots are empty. To solve this, we need to pull all nine values out of the `board` var. We could do this manually, but a faster solution is to use destructuring. Let's start with a simple example of destructuring. Imagine you created a vector of names...

```clojure
(def names ["Alice" "Bob" "Charlie"])
```

If you wanted to pull them all out and print them, you could use `get` to retrieve them one at a time like this:

```clojure
(let [alice (get names 0)
      bob (get names 1)
      charlie (get names 2)]
  (println alice bob charlie))
```

Or, you could use destructuring to pull them all out at once:

```clojure
(let [[alice bob charlie] names]
  (println alice bob charlie))
```

This is a pretty powerful facility, and it works on multi-dimensional data structures like the tic-tac-toe board. Going back to our project, we can pull out each individual value from the board like this:

```clojure
...

(defn -main []
  (let [[[a b c]
         [d e f]
         [g h i]] board]
    (println a b c d e f g h i)))
```

Click "Run with REPL". When the prompt appears, run `(-main)` and confirm that you can see all nine spots printed out. The next question is, how do we determine if someone won? There are exactly eight possible ways to win. There are three horizontal lines, three vertical lines, and two diagonal lines.

So, what we need to do is create a vector for each possible line, and check to see if any of them are `[:x :x :x]` or `[:o :o :o]`. What should we store the possibilities in? Since we are essentially going to ask whether it *contains* a value, the most logical answer would be a hash set.

Hash sets are very fast at checking whether they contain a value. For example, if you made a hash set of names like this:

```clojure
(def names (hash-set "Alice" "Bob" "Charlie"))
```

You could easily check if it contains a certain name like this:

```clojure
(contains? names "Bob")
```

Hash sets are much faster at checking their contents than vectors, so it would make a lot of sense to use them here. Let's make a local var called `solutions` that contains all eight possibilities:

```clojure
...

(defn -main []
  (let [[[a b c]
         [d e f]
         [g h i]] board
        solutions (hash-set
                    [a b c]
                    [d e f]
                    [g h i]
                    [a d g]
                    [b e h]
                    [c f i]
                    [a e i]
                    [c e g])]
    solutions))
```

Save, reload, and run `(-main)` in the REPL again. You should get the following, which is a hash set containing the vectors you specified:

```clojure
#{[:x :e :o] [:o :e :x] [:e :e :e] [:x :e :e] [:x :x :x] [:o :e :o]}
```

Now, all we need to do is check if it contains a win. If neither side won, we should return `nil`. In another language, we might use `if` and `else if` statements. The equivalent in Clojure is called `cond`, and it looks like this:

```clojure
...

(defn -main []
  (let [[[a b c]
         [d e f]
         [g h i]] board
        solutions (hash-set
                    [a b c]
                    [d e f]
                    [g h i]
                    [a d g]
                    [b e h]
                    [c f i]
                    [a e i]
                    [c e g])]
    (cond
      (contains? solutions [:x :x :x]) :x
      (contains? solutions [:o :o :o]) :o
      :else nil)))
```

Save, reload, and run `(-main)` in the REPL again. It should now return `:x`, which means the first branch, `(contains? solutions [:x :x :x])`, was true, causing `cond` to return the value next to it. You can try modifying the `board` to make sure it works for other arrangements.

## microblog-clojure

Create a new console project called `microblog-clojure`. In your project.clj, add the three libraries we added yesterday:

```clojure
(defproject microblog-clojure "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
                 [ring "1.4.0"]
                 [hiccup "1.0.5"]
                 [compojure "1.5.0"]]
  :javac-options ["-target" "1.6" "-source" "1.6" "-Xlint:-options"]
  :aot [microblog-clojure.core]
  :main microblog-clojure.core)
```

Save it, then open core.clj. We'll start by just setting it up to show "Hello, world!" at the main `/` route. We'll also use the same technique we used before to make the server restart every time we run the main function:

```clojure
(ns microblog-clojure.core
  (:require [compojure.core :as c]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :as j])
  (:gen-class))

(c/defroutes app
  (c/GET "/" request
    "Hello, world!"))

(defonce server (atom nil))

(defn -main []
  (when @server
    (.stop @server))
  (reset! server (j/run-jetty app {:port 3000 :join? false})))
```
