## General

* Use [Nightcode](https://sekao.net/nightcode/)
* Focus on data structures
  * Emphasize the distinction between code and data
  * Think about the data first, and the code will follow
  * Design projects specifically around use of various data structures
* Start with a Clojure REPL instead of overwhelming students with a full project structure

## Week 1 - Intro

* Define Clojure
  * A Lisp
  * for Functional Programming
  * symbiotic with an established Platform
  * designed for Concurrency
* Lisp
  * The "Big Four" data structures (list, vector, map, set)
  * Code is represented as lists
  * Functions and Macros
* Functional Programming
  * Immutable Data
  * First-class Functions
* Web apps with ring, hiccup, and compojure

## Week 2 - Recursion and Parallelism

* Recursion with `loop` and `recur`
* Parallelism with `pmap`
