## General

* Use industry-standard tools
  * JDK 8
  * IntelliJ + [Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/)
* Focus on data structures
  * Emphasize the distinction between code and data
  * Think about the data first, and the code will follow
  * Design projects specifically around use of various data structures
* Start with a Clojure REPL instead of overwhelming students with a full project structure

## Week 1

* Define Clojure
  * A Lisp
  * for Functional Programming
  * symbiotic with an established Platform
  * designed for Concurrency
* Lisp
  * The "Big Four" data structures (list, vector, map, set)
  * Code is represented as lists
  * Functions and Macros
* Functional Programming
  * Immutable Data
  * First-class Functions
  * Lazy Sequences

## Week 2

* Java Interop
  * Introduce the syntax
  * "Embrace the platform" philosophy
* Parallelism and Concurrency
  * Parallelism: pmap, pvalues
  * Concurrency: var, atom, ref, agent
