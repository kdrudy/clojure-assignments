Recursion is a difficult concept to grasp, but it can be a powerful and elegant way of solving problems. Today we'll learn how to use it in both Java and Clojure by creating a simple maze generation program.

## MazeJava

Create a new Java project in IntelliJ. As usual, we will start by thinking about what data we need to generate a maze. The most fundamental thing we need is the concept of a "room", which will represent a single square in a maze. We need to create a `Room` class that keeps track of its location in the maze (row and column number), whether or not its been "visited" by the maze crawler, and whether or not it has its bottom and right walls (it doesn't care about the top and left walls because they're part of some other room).

```java
public class Room {
    int row;
    int col;
    boolean wasVisited = false;
    boolean hasBottom = true;
    boolean hasRight = true;

    public Room(int row, int col) {
        this.row = row;
        this.col = col;
    }
}
```

In the main class, we can start by making a method called `createRooms` which returns an `ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>>`. A two-dimensional collection of `Room`s can thus represent the entire maze. To do that, let's hard-code it as a 10x10 grid of rooms:

```java
public class Main {
    static final int SIZE = 10;

    static ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> createRooms() {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int row = 0; row < SIZE; row++) {
            ArrayList<Room> roomRow = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int col = 0; col < SIZE; col++) {
                roomRow.add(new Room(row, col));
            }
            rooms.add(roomRow);
        }
        return rooms;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = createRooms();
        System.out.println(rooms);
    }
}
```

Try running the main method to confirm that we've created a bunch of `Room` objects in a two-dimentional `ArrayList`. Now let's make it actually draw an ASCII graphic of the maze. To do that, we can create nested `for` loops that print out `_|` for each room. The end result should look like this:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = createRooms();
        for (ArrayList<Room> row : rooms) {
            System.out.print(" _");
        }
        System.out.println();
        for (ArrayList<Room> row : rooms) {
            System.out.print("|");
            for (Room room : row) {
                System.out.print("_");
                System.out.print("|");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run it, you'll see this:

```
 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
```

Looking good! We'll need to modify it later to print gaps in the appropriate places, but we'll get to that later. The way our maze crawler will work is, it will start at a given room and simply continuously try going to a neighboring room and "knocking" the wall down in the process. Once it can't find any valid neighboring rooms, it will stop crawling.

So, we need a method called `randomNeighbor` that takes a `row` and `col`, and returns a random room that hasn't been visited yet. We can do this by creating an `ArrayList<Room>` and finding the four surrounding rooms from the main `rooms` variable. We'll need to use `if` statements because if we're near an edge we don't want to add a non-existent room that is off the grid:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static Room randomNeighbor(ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms, int row, int col) {
        ArrayList<Room> neighbors = new ArrayList<>();

        if (row > 0) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row-1).get(col));
        if (row < SIZE-1) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row+1).get(col));
        if (col > 0) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row).get(col-1));
        if (col < SIZE-1) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row).get(col+1));

        return null;
    }
    
    ...
}
```

We're not finished yet. We now need to filter `neighbors` so it does not contain any rooms we've already visited. We can do this with a stream:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static Room randomNeighbor(ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms, int row, int col) {
        ...
        
        neighbors = neighbors.stream()
                .filter(room -> {
                    return !room.wasVisited;
                })
                .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList<Room>::new));

        return null;
    }
    
    ...
}
```

Finally, we need to try grabbing a random `Room` object from `neighbors`. We can use the `Random` class to do this:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static Room randomNeighbor(ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms, int row, int col) {
        ...
        
        if (neighbors.size() > 0) {
            Random r = new Random();
            int index = r.nextInt(neighbors.size());
            return neighbors.get(index);
        }

        return null;
    }
    
    ...
}
```

We now have a method that returns a random neighboring `Room` object, or `null` if none is found. It's now time to write the method that tears down the wall when we enter the random room. Let's write `tearDownWall`, which simply takes two `Room` objects and sets either `hasBottom` or `hasRight` to false depending on where the old and new rooms are relative to each other:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static void tearDownWall(Room oldRoom, Room newRoom) {
        // going up
        if (newRoom.row < oldRoom.row) {
            newRoom.hasBottom = false;
        }
        // going down
        else if (newRoom.row > oldRoom.row) {
            oldRoom.hasBottom = false;
        }
        // going left
        else if (newRoom.col < oldRoom.col) {
            newRoom.hasRight = false;
        }
        // going right
        else if (newRoom.col > oldRoom.col) {
            oldRoom.hasRight = false;
        }
    }
    
    ...
}
```

We're now ready to create the maze! We need to write a recursive method called `createMaze`, which receives a `Room` object and looks for a random neighbor. If it doesn't find one, it returns `false`; otherwise, it calls `tearDownWall` and then calls *itself* continuously until it no longer can find neighboring rooms:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static boolean createMaze(ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms, Room room) {
        room.wasVisited = true;
        Room nextRoom = randomNeighbor(rooms, room.row, room.col);
        if (nextRoom == null) {
            return false;
        }

        tearDownWall(room, nextRoom);

        while (createMaze(rooms, nextRoom));

        return true;
    }
    
    ...
}
```

We are now ready to try it. First, let's modify how we print the maze so we print a space character instead of `_` and `|` if `hasBottom` or `hasRight` are false (respectively):

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ...
        for (ArrayList<Room> row : rooms) {
            System.out.print("|");
            for (Room room : row) {
                if (room.hasBottom) {
                    System.out.print("_");
                } else {
                    System.out.print(" ");
                }

                if (room.hasRight) {
                    System.out.print("|");
                } else {
                    System.out.print(" ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, we can simply call `createMaze` before printing out the rooms:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = createRooms();
        createMaze(rooms, rooms.get(0).get(0));
        ...
    }
}
```

When you run it, you should get something like this:

```
 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|_  |  _ _     _|   |
| | | |  _| |_|  _| |
| | |_  |  _|  _|  _|
| | |_  |_ _ _| |_  |
| |_  |_  |_ _   _| |
| |  _|_ _   _ _|  _|
|  _|_    | |   |_  |
| |  _ _| | | |_  | |
| | | |  _|_| |  _| |
|_ _|_ _ _ _ _|_ _ _|
```

## maze-clojure

Now we'll try the same thing in Clojure. Create a project with Nightcode and open `core.clj`. Click "Run with REPL" to start the REPL. Unlike Java, where we represented a room with a special class, in Clojure it is more idiomatic to use a hash map for this. For example, the first room might look like this:

```clojure
{:row 0, :col 0, :visited? false, :bottom? true, :right? true}
```

Our first step is to make the `create-rooms` function, which returns a two-dimensional collection of those hash maps. We can do this by simply making a `for` loop inside another `for` loop:

```clojure
(ns maze-clojure.core
  (:gen-class))

(def size 10)

(defn create-rooms []
  (for [row (range size)]
    (for [col (range size)]
      {:row row, :col col, :visited? false, :bottom? true, :right? true})))
```

Save, reload, and run `(create-rooms)` in the REPL. It should print out a bunch of lists with hash maps in them. Now run `(def rooms (create-rooms))` to save it into a var. Now try running `(get rooms 0)`. Theoretically, this should return the first row of rooms, but instead you get `nil`!

This is because `for` loops in Clojure return lists, which don't behave the same as vectors. Items in lists cannot be looked up by index, because lists don't have an index. If you want to do that, you must use vectors instead. We can use the `vec` function to convert a list into a vector. We'll need to surround both the inner and outer `for` loops with it:

```clojure
...

(defn create-rooms []
  (vec
    (for [row (range size)]
      (vec
        (for [col (range size)]
          {:row row, :col col, :visited? false, :bottom? true, :right? true})))))
```

Save, reload, and run `(def rooms (create-rooms))` again. Then run `(get rooms 0)`. We get back a vector of rooms this time!
