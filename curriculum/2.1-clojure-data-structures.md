## CardsJava

Create a new Java project. We're going to try to calculate all possible four-card hands (we'll avoid five-card hands to make it compute faster). To kick things off, we will, as always, start with our data. To represent a card in Java, let's create a class that uses enums for the suit and the rank:

```java
public class Card {
    enum Suit {
        CLUBS,
        DIAMONDS,
        HEARTS,
        SPADES
    }

    enum Rank {
        ACE,
        TWO,
        THREE,
        FOUR,
        FIVE,
        SIX,
        SEVEN,
        EIGHT,
        NINE,
        TEN,
        JACK,
        QUEEN,
        KING
    }

    Suit suit;
    Rank rank;
    
    public Card(Suit suit, Rank rank) {
        this.suit = suit;
        this.rank = rank;
    }
}
```

Now, in the main class, create a method that returns a deck of cards by iterating over both enums. We'll store them in a `HashSet` to make sure the deck has only unique cards:

```java
public class Main {
    static HashSet<Card> createDeck() {
        HashSet<Card> deck = new HashSet();
        for (Card.Suit suit : Card.Suit.values()) {
            for (Card.Rank rank : Card.Rank.values()) {
                Card c = new Card(suit, rank);
                deck.add(c);
            }
        }
        return deck;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
```

Before we go on, let's try it out. In the main method, create a deck and try to add another card to it.

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<Card> deck = createDeck();
        deck.add(new Card(Card.Suit.SPADES, Card.Rank.ACE));
        System.out.println(deck.size());
    }
}
```

We have a problem! Somehow, the `HashSet` allowed us to add an ace of spades, even though it already has one. This is because we haven't taught Java how to determine equality of cards. To do so, go back to the cards class and right click inside the file to access IntelliJ's "Generate..." feature. Choose the "equals and hashCode" option. IntelliJ will generate them for you like this:

```java
public class Card {
    ...
    
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

        Card card = (Card) o;

        if (suit != card.suit) return false;
        return rank == card.rank;

    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = suit.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + rank.hashCode();
        return result;
    }
}
```

Now when you re-run the main method, the deck should have 52 cards. Now let's attempt to write the method that generates all possible hands. This will end up giving us a `HashSet<HashSet<Card>>`, because we want to make sure we don't have any duplicate hands as well. We can do this by creating several layers of `for` loops:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static HashSet<HashSet<Card>> createHands(HashSet<Card> deck) {
        HashSet<HashSet<Card>> hands = new HashSet();
        for (Card c1 : deck) {
            HashSet<Card> deck2 = (HashSet<Card>) deck.clone();
            deck2.remove(c1);
            for (Card c2 : deck2) {
                HashSet<Card> deck3 = (HashSet<Card>) deck2.clone();
                deck3.remove(c2);
                for (Card c3 : deck3) {
                    HashSet<Card> deck4 = (HashSet<Card>) deck3.clone();
                    deck4.remove(c3);
                    for (Card c4 : deck4) {
                        HashSet<Card> hand = new HashSet();
                        hand.add(c1);
                        hand.add(c2);
                        hand.add(c3);
                        hand.add(c4);
                        hands.add(hand);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return hands;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<Card> deck = createDeck();
        HashSet<HashSet<Card>> hands = createHands(deck);
        System.out.println(hands.size());
    }
}
```

The changes to the main method should now make it print out the number of all possible four-card hands. According to [this resource](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~alspach/comp17/), the answer should be 270,725.

Now let's try to filter out only the decks which are flushes. We can just make a method that checks a single deck. Then we can use a stream to filter the results with that method:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static boolean isFlush(HashSet<Card> hand) {
        HashSet<Card.Suit> suits = hand.stream()
                .map(card -> {
                    return card.suit;
                })
                .collect(Collectors.toCollection(HashSet::new));
        return suits.size() == 1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<Card> deck = createDeck();
        HashSet<HashSet<Card>> hands = createHands(deck);
        hands = hands.stream()
                .filter(Main::isFlush)
                .collect(Collectors.toCollection(HashSet::new));
        System.out.println(hands.size());
    }
}
```

## cards-clojure

Create a new console project. In Clojure, it's normal to represent most things with plain data structures. In the case of, for example, a 10 of hearts, we could represent it as a hash map: `{:rank 10, :suit :hearts}`. Let's click "Run with REPL" and open `core.clj`. We'll start by creating a few vars holding the possible ranks and suits:

```clojure
(ns cards-clojure.core
  (:gen-class))

(def suits [:clubs :spades :hearts :diamonds])
(def ranks (range 1 14))
```

Save and reload, and type `ranks` in the REPL. You can see it is a list from 1 to 13. Now let's write `create-deck`. In Clojure, we can simulate multiple `for` loops by simply passing multiple bindings to it. It will return a list, so we need to pass the result to the `set` function to make a hash set:

```clojure
...

(defn create-deck []
  (set
    (for [suit suits
          rank ranks]
      {:suit suit
       :rank rank})))
```

Save and reload, and run `(create-deck)` in the REPL. We now have a set with 52 cards! Now let's write `create-hands`:

```clojure
...

(defn create-hands [deck]
  (set
    (for [c1 deck
          c2 (disj deck c1)
          c3 (disj deck c1 c2)
          c4 (disj deck c1 c2 c3)]
      #{c1 c2 c3 c4})))
```

With sets in Clojure, we don't need to do the equivalent of overriding `equals` and `hashCode`, because values in Clojure are immutable and thus equality checks always compare values. For that reason, the code is much more terse. Save and reload, and run the following in the REPL: `(count (create-hands (create-deck)))`. We should get 270,725.

Now that we are successfully generating all possible four-card hands, let's filter out the flushes. First, we'll write the `flush?` function:

```clojure
...

(defn flush? [hand]
  (= 1 (count (set (map :suit hand)))))
```

Let's use it in the main function to print the number of flushes:

```clojure
...

(defn -main []
  (let [deck (create-deck)
        hands (create-hands deck)
        flush-hands (filter flush? hands)]
    (println (count flush-hands))))
```
