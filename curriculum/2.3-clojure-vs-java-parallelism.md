One of the most obvious benefits of functional programming is that it makes parallelism much simpler to achieve. Whereas `for` loops are inherently single-threaded, doing the same thing with `map` and `filter` could potentially be run on multiple threads at once. We'll see how this works by building a visual demonstration of parallelism with Java and then Clojure.

## AntsJava

Create a new Java project. Download [main.fxml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oakes/clojure-assignments/master/projects/Ants/src/com/theironyard/main.fxml) and move it next to your main class. Then modify the main class to display the fxml file in a JavaFX window:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    static final int WIDTH = 800;
    static final int HEIGHT = 600;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource("main.fxml"));
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

        primaryStage.setTitle("Ants");
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```

Now let's define our data. We will represent ants as little black dots, and all they need to store is their position:

```java
public class Ant {
    double x;
    double y;

    public Ant(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

Next, go back to the main class and define `ANT_COUNT`, an `ArrayList<Ant>` to store the ants, and a `createAnts` method that provides a random location to them:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    static final int WIDTH = 800;
    static final int HEIGHT = 600;
    
    static final int ANT_COUNT = 100;

    ArrayList<Ant> ants;

    static ArrayList<Ant> createAnts() {
        ArrayList<Ant> ants = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < ANT_COUNT; i++) {
            Random r = new Random();
            ants.add(new Ant(r.nextInt(WIDTH), r.nextInt(HEIGHT)));
        }
        return ants;
    }

    ...
}
```

Then create a `drawAnts` method that loops over the list and draws them on the provided `GraphicsContext`:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    void drawAnts(GraphicsContext context) {
        context.clearRect(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
        for (Ant ant : ants) {
            context.setFill(Color.BLACK);
            context.fillOval(ant.x, ant.y, 5, 5);
        }
    }

    ...
}
```

Let's try to run it. At the end of the `start` method, write the following, run the code and verify that you see a window with random black dots:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        ...
        
        Canvas canvas = (Canvas) scene.lookup("#canvas");
        GraphicsContext context = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();

        ants = createAnts();
        drawAnts(context);
    }

    ...
}
```

Now let's make them move. Let's write a `moveAnt` method that takes a single `Ant` object and makes a random modification to its `x` and `y`, and a `moveAnts` method that maps it over all the ants:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    Ant moveAnt(Ant ant) {
        ant.x += Math.random() * 2 - 1;
        ant.y += Math.random() * 2 - 1;
        return ant;
    }
    
    void moveAnts() {
        ants = ants.stream()
                .map(this::moveAnt)
                .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList<Ant>::new));
    }

    ...
}
```

Now let's modify the `start` method to call `moveAnts` and `drawAnts` in a timer:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        ...

        ants = createAnts();
        
        AnimationTimer timer = new AnimationTimer() {
            @Override
            public void handle(long now) {
                moveAnts();
                drawAnts(context);
            }
        };
        timer.start();
    }

    ...
}
```

The ants should now be moving! Let's add a label that displays the frames per second. First, write a method that calculates the fps for a given timestamp. We'll need to define a field called `lastTimestamp` that saves the timestamp of the last frame:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    long lastTimestamp = 0;
    
    int fps(long now) {
        double diff = now - lastTimestamp;
        double diffSeconds = diff / 1000000000;
        return (int) (1 / diffSeconds);
    }

    ...
}
```

Now get access to the fps label and make it update the number using that method:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        ...

        Label fpsLabel = (Label) scene.lookup("#fps");

        AnimationTimer timer = new AnimationTimer() {
            @Override
            public void handle(long now) {
                moveAnts();
                drawAnts(context);
                fpsLabel.setText(fps(now) + "");
                lastTimestamp = now;
            }
        };
        timer.start();
    }

    ...
}
```

You should see fairly decent frames per second. The `moveAnts` method is currently running single-threaded and is fast enough as-is. Let's make it artificially slow so we can see what effect parallelism might have on it. Modify `moveAnt` to sleep for one millisecond:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    Ant moveAnt(Ant ant) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        ant.x += Math.random() * 2 - 1;
        ant.y += Math.random() * 2 - 1;
        return ant;
    }

    ...
}
```

Run it and note the fps you see. Then, modify `moveAnts` to use a parallel stream:

```java
public class Main extends Application {
    ...
    
    void moveAnts() {
        ants = ants.parallelStream()
                .map(this::moveAnt)
                .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList<Ant>::new));
    }

    ...
}
```

If you have a multi-core processor, you should get much better frames per second from changing just that single line of code!
