## people-clojure

In Nightcode, click "New Project", and after choosing whatever directory you'd like to store your projects in, write `people-clojure` in the text field. In the next dialog, simply leave "Console" selected and click "Create Project".

In the project tree on the left, drill down into the `src` folder and select `core.clj`. Right now, it should look like this:

```clojure
(ns people-clojure.core
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main []
  (println "Hello, World!"))
```

The `-main` function is equivalent to the main method in Java. In this case, it takes zero arguments (hence the empty `[]`) and prints something. What we want to do is build a simple program that lets you type lines of text, saves them somewhere, and prints them all out when you are finished.

First, try clicking the "Run" button in the bottom right pane. After some time, you should see it print the text out. Running a program this way is normal for most languages, but in Clojure, we typically develop interactively by running a REPL. It provides a much faster feedback loop.

The REPL on the bottom left is standalone, but we need a special REPL that runs inside our project. To get it, click "Run with REPL" in the bottom right pane. Eventually you'll see a prompt appear in the pane. Now try running `(-main)` and you'll see it print again.

Now change string in your code (for example, add an exclaimation point). After saving, hit the "Reload" button, which will reload the REPL with the latest changes. Now try running `(-main)` again in the REPL and confirm that the changed string is now printing. This is a much faster way to make and try changes than constantly re-running the project.
