## people-clojure

Now that we have parsed the CSV file, let's modify our project to display it on a webpage. To do so, we're going to need to add a few libraries to our `project.clj` file. Open it up and you'll see something like this:

```clojure
(defproject people-clojure "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]]
  :javac-options ["-target" "1.6" "-source" "1.6" "-Xlint:-options"]
  :aot [people-clojure.core]
  :main people-clojure.core)
```

This file lists some metadata about the project. The most important part is `:dependencies`, which lists what libraries we are using. Currently, we are just using Clojure itself. Let's add several other libraries like this:

```clojure
(defproject people-clojure "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
                 [ring "1.4.0"]
                 [hiccup "1.0.5"]
                 [compojure "1.5.0"]]
  :javac-options ["-target" "1.6" "-source" "1.6" "-Xlint:-options"]
  :aot [people-clojure.core]
  :main people-clojure.core)
```

Save the file. If you are currently running anything, click "Stop", because it won't retrieve the new libraries if it is still running. Now let's start a new REPL by hitting "Run with REPL".

Our first goal is to remove some of the code at the end of the `-main` function so, instead of the user typing a country name and writing the results to a file, we simply return all the parsed data so we can display it on a page. The resulting main function should look like this:

```clojure
(defn -main []
  (let [people (slurp "people.csv")
        people (str/split-lines people)
        people (map (fn [line]
                      (str/split line #","))
                 people)
        header (first people)
        people (rest people)
        people (map (fn [line]
                      (zipmap header line))
                 people)]
    people))
```

Now letâ€™s move it out of the main function so we can free it up for all of our web server code. The easiest way to do that is to simply rename `-main` to something else, such as `read-people`:

```clojure
(ns people-clojure.core
  (:require [clojure.string :as str])
  (:gen-class))

(defn read-people []
  ...)
```

Next, we need to add our web server code. We'll be using a library called compojure to define a GET route. We need to add it into our `:require` list, which is kind of like an import statement in Java. We'll alias the library with the letter `c` to make it easier to refer to later:

```clojure
(ns people-clojure.core
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
            [compojure.core :as c])
  (:gen-class))

...
```

Now we can define our first route. The syntax for this involves using `defroutes` and creating a GET route inside of it. The `request` var represents a hash map containing all the information, including parameters, about the request:

```clojure
...

(c/defroutes app
  (c/GET "/" request
    "Hello, world!"))
```

The next thing we need to do is start the web server. We'll use Jetty, which you can add to the `:require` list like this:

```clojure
(ns people-clojure.core
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
            [compojure.core :as c]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :as j])
  (:gen-class))

...
```

The most logical place to start the server is in the main function, so we will recreate that. We simply need to start the server and pass it the `app` var so it knows what routes to create.

```clojure
...

(defn -main []
  (j/run-jetty app {:port 3000}))
```
