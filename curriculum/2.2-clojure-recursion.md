Recursion is a difficult concept to grasp, but it can be a powerful and elegant way of solving problems. Today we'll learn how to use it in both Java and Clojure by creating a simple maze generation program.

## MazeJava

Create a new Java project in IntelliJ. As usual, we will start by thinking about what data we need to generate a maze. The most fundamental thing we need is the concept of a "room", which will represent a single square in a maze. We need to create a `Room` class that keeps track of its location in the maze (row and column number), whether or not its been "visited" by the maze crawler, and whether or not it has its bottom and right walls (it doesn't care about the top and left walls because they're part of some other room).

```java
public class Room {
    int row;
    int col;
    boolean wasVisited = false;
    boolean hasBottom = true;
    boolean hasRight = true;

    public Room(int row, int col) {
        this.row = row;
        this.col = col;
    }
}
```

In the main class, we can start by making a method called `createRooms` which returns an `ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>>`. A two-dimensional collection of `Room`s can thus represent the entire maze. To do that, let's hard-code it as a 10x10 grid of rooms:

```java
public class Main {
    static final int SIZE = 10;

    static ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> createRooms() {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int row = 0; row < SIZE; row++) {
            ArrayList<Room> roomRow = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int col = 0; col < SIZE; col++) {
                roomRow.add(new Room(row, col));
            }
            rooms.add(roomRow);
        }
        return rooms;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = createRooms();
        System.out.println(rooms);
    }
}
```

Try running the main method to confirm that we've created a bunch of `Room` objects in a two-dimentional `ArrayList`. Now let's make it actually draw an ASCII graphic of the maze. To do that, we can create nested `for` loops that print out `_|` for each room. The end result should look like this:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = createRooms();
        for (ArrayList<Room> row : rooms) {
            System.out.print(" _");
        }
        System.out.println();
        for (ArrayList<Room> row : rooms) {
            System.out.print("|");
            for (Room room : row) {
                System.out.print("_");
                System.out.print("|");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run it, you'll see this:

```
 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
```

Looking good! We'll need to modify it later to print gaps in the appropriate places, but we'll get to that later.

Now we need a method called `possibleNeighbors` that takes a `row` and `col`, and returns all the neighboring rooms that haven't been visited yet. We can do this by creating an `ArrayList<Room>` and finding the four surrounding rooms from the main `rooms` variable. We'll need to use `if` statements because if we're near an edge we don't want to add a non-existent room that is off the grid:

```java
public class Main {
    ...
    
    static ArrayList<Room> possibleNeighbors(ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms, int row, int col) {
        ArrayList<Room> neighbors = new ArrayList<>();

        if (row > 0) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row-1).get(col));
        if (row < SIZE-1) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row+1).get(col));
        if (col > 0) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row).get(col-1));
        if (col < SIZE-1) neighbors.add(rooms.get(row).get(col+1));

        return neighbors;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Room>> rooms = createRooms();
        ...
        System.out.println(possibleNeighbors(rooms, 0, 1));
    }
}
```

When you run the main method, it should print out an `ArrayList` containing three `Room` objects, since the room at `0,1` only has three neighbors.
